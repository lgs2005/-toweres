# TowerES

An attempt at implementing [ECMAScript 2025](https://tc39.es/ecma262/), more commonly known as JavaScript.

The goal is to develop a program in Rust, with as little dependencies as possible, that can execute JavaScript code and passes all of [test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262).

"Why?" why not

Some code is copied/translated/other from third parties. This code is separated into it's own crate with the licensing information attached.

# Current Progress

very little
