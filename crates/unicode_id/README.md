# Unicode ID\_

This crate contains generated code for identifying unicode characters with the "ID_Start" and "ID_Continue" properties. This code was generated with an implementation of the same method as the [`unicode-ident`](https://github.com/dtolnay/unicode-ident) crate.

The subcrate `generator` uses files from the [Unicode Database](https://www.unicode.org/ucd/) to generate code files. The Unicode Database is under the [UNICODE](./LICENSE-UNICODE) license, which also applies to the data contained in the generated code files.
